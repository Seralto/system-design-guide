      "title": "What is System Design?",
      "paragraph1": "System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, data flow, and interactions of a software system to meet specified goals. It involves making high-level decisions that balance trade-offs across performance, scalability, reliability, maintainability, cost, and complexity.",
      "paragraph2": "At its core, system design is about solving real-world problems through structured thinking, clear abstractions, and technical insight. Whether you're building a social media platform, an e-commerce website, or a real-time multiplayer game, system design ensures that your system can grow, adapt, and perform under load.",
      "paragraph3": "Unlike implementation, which focuses on isolated features, system design looks at the \"big picture\", how different parts of a system fit and work together. It's a collaborative and creative process that often starts long before the first line of code is written."
